# QuantumAlgos

This repo has qiskit implementations for basic quantum algorithms
I added:

- Binary Adder
- Superdense coding protocol
- Quantum teleportation protocol
- Quantum Fourier Trasform (QFT)


I still want to add:

- Phase estimation
- Amplitdue estimation
These are the algoritms used in ODE solvers

- Grover's algoritm (unstructured search)
- Some optimization algoritms (I haven't read much about them yet)
